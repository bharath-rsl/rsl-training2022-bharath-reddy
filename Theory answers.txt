UIWIndow acts as a cotainer for presenting the views.It is the topmost UI container for any ios application.
It is the root view of the view hierarchy.
It does not have any visible content,instead fecilitate other view controllers to present.
Generally any ios application will have only one window object.

 UIScene:
It is a class that represents one instance of a application.
Every scene has its own delegate object.
When the state of the scene changes, the scene object notifies its delegate object and appropiate method is executed.
Generally we never create UIScene object,uikit does it automatically.
Every scene has a lifecycle with diferen states and each state has a associated delegate method.

My observations on lifecycle events.

viewDidLoad (this method is executed only once,when the viewcontroller is loaded for the first time)


viewWillAppear (this method is eecuted just before the view appearing on the screen)


These two methods are executed when viewcontroller about to layout the subviews and after laying out subviews.
I have also observed that these methods are getting called when screen is rotated.
viewWillLayoutSubviews
viewDidLayoutSubviews
viewWillTransitionToSize




viewDidAppear (this method is executed just after the view appearing on the screen)


These two methods are executed when the view is disappearing from the foreground.
ViewwillDisappear
ViewDIdDisappear
