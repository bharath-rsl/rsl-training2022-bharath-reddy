1)
a)AppLaunch:

    When the user taps on the app,it goes to launch state(inactive state) then it goes to foreground active state
    (app).
     willFinishLaunchingWithOptions:
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:

   (scene based)
    willConnecttoSession
    configurationForConnectingSceneSession:options:

b)Background:
    first app deactivates,then moves to background.

        (scene based)
   sceneWillResignActive:
sceneDidEnterBackground:
 
         (app based)  
  applicationWillResignActive:
  applicationDidEnterBackground:

c)Lock phone

      it is same as app going into background
        (scene based)
   sceneWillResignActive:
sceneDidEnterBackground:
 
         (app based)  
  applicationWillResignActive:
  applicationDidEnterBackground:




d)Simulate memory warning:
   I think there is only one common method to or memory warning for both scene and app based.
               applicationDidReceiveMemoryWarning:
 
 

e)App Kill
   It might depend on how the app gets killed.Usual way is press home button(which moves app to background)s and remove it from recent apps.
   Then the same delegate methods that are called for background state are called again.
   
  (scene based)
   sceneWillResignActive:
sceneDidEnterBackground:
 
         (app based)  
  applicationWillResignActive:
  applicationDidEnterBackground:

viewWillTransitionToSize: method has 2 parameters: 1)(CGSize)size  2)(id<UIViewControllerTransitionCoordinator>)coordinator
   
'size' is a structure with height and width as instance properties.
we can extract width and height from 'size' parameter.
