According to what i have read, accessing instant variables thourgh '.'(dot) operator is exaclty same as calling the
corresponding getter and setter method.

Let 'student' be a object with a instant variable "name".

   student.name    <====> [student name]    (getter)
   
   student.name=@"bharath"   <====>  [student setName:@"bharath"]    (setter)
   
 Whenever we use "." operator,internally it transorms into usal get and set method call.

 So,if we use '.' operator to access instant variables in getter or setter methods,it will go into infinite reccursive call.
 
 
 -(void)name{                             -(void)name{
    return(self.name);     <===>            return([self name]);          //infinite recursive call
 
 }                                         }
